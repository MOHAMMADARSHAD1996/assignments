Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.A1. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and management. Databases are used to store information for various applications, ranging from simple data storage to complex data processing systems.

SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two major categories of database management systems with distinct characteristics:

SQL Databases:

SQL databases, also known as relational databases, store data in structured tables with rows and columns.
They have a well-defined schema that defines the structure of the data, including data types, relationships, and constraints.
SQL databases use the SQL language to perform operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
They are well-suited for applications with structured and tabular data, where data integrity and relationships between tables are important.
Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.
NoSQL Databases:

NoSQL databases provide a more flexible approach to data storage and retrieval, often eschewing a fixed schema.
They can handle various types of data, including unstructured or semi-structured data like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, and time-series data.
NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally and handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.
They are suitable for applications where the data structure is not well-defined from the beginning, and where the ability to scale and handle diverse data types is important.
Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value store), Neo4j (graph database), and Cassandra (wide-column store).
In summary, the key difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in their data models, schemas, and the way they handle data. SQL databases are best for structured data with predefined relationships, while NoSQL databases are more flexible and suited for handling various types of unstructured or semi-structured data and supporting horizontal scalability. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements of the application and the nature of the data being stored and processed.Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.A2. DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define, manage, and manipulate the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. DDL focuses on the design and structure of the database rather than the data itself.
Let's explore the four main DDL statements and their purposes with examples:
CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, and more.
Example - Creating a Table:
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE
);


DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove existing database objects, such as tables or indexes. This permanently deletes the object and its associated data.
Example - Dropping a Table:
DROP TABLE employees;


ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify existing database objects. It can be used to add, modify, or delete columns in a table, change data types, or add constraints.
Example - Adding a Column:
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);

TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly remove all rows from a table, effectively resetting it to an empty state. Unlike the DROP statement, TRUNCATE does not remove the table itself.
Example - Truncating a Table:
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

In summary, DDL statements are essential for defining and managing the structure of a database. CREATE is used to create new objects, DROP is used to remove objects, ALTER is used to modify objects, and TRUNCATE is used to quickly remove all data from a table. Each statement plays a crucial role in database schema management and design.Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.A3. DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate and operate on the data stored within a database. DML statements are used to insert, update, and delete data in database tables. Unlike DDL (Data Definition Language), which focuses on defining and managing the structure of the database, DML focuses on the manipulation of the data itself.

Let's explore the three main DML statements and their purposes with examples:

INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table.
Example - Inserting a New Row:
INSERT INTO employees (id, first_name, last_name, hire_date)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2023-01-15');
UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. It changes the values of specific columns in one or more rows.
Example - Updating Data:
UPDATE employees
SET first_name = 'Jane', last_name = 'Smith'
WHERE id = 1;

DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove specific rows from a table.
Example - Deleting Data:

DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id = 1;

In the examples above:

The INSERT statement adds a new employee to the "employees" table.
The UPDATE statement changes the first name and last name of an employee with a specific ID.
The DELETE statement removes an employee with a specific ID from the "employees" table.
These DML statements are used to modify the actual data stored within the tables, allowing for data manipulation and maintenance in a relational database system.Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.A4. DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve data from a database. DQL is primarily focused on querying and retrieving information from one or more database tables. The primary DQL statement is the SELECT statement.

SELECT Statement:
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve and provides options to filter, sort, and aggregate the data.

Example - Selecting Data:
Assume we have a "products" table with columns product_id, product_name, price, and category.
SELECT product_id, product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
ORDER BY price DESC;
In the above example:

We specify the columns we want to retrieve using the column names (product_id, product_name, and price).
We specify the table we're retrieving data from (products).
We use the WHERE clause to filter the results to only include products in the 'Electronics' category.
We use the ORDER BY clause to sort the results in descending order based on the price column.
The result of the SELECT statement will be a table of rows with the selected columns' values from the "products" table, filtered and sorted as specified.

The SELECT statement is fundamental to querying databases, and it offers a wide range of options to retrieve data in various ways, including filtering, joining multiple tables, performing calculations, and more.Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.Sure, I'd be happy to explain primary keys and foreign keys in the context of relational databases.

Primary Key:
A primary key is a column or set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It serves as a unique identifier for each record, and its values must be unique and not null. The primary key enforces data integrity by ensuring that no two rows in the table can have the same primary key values. Primary keys are used to establish relationships between tables and are crucial for maintaining data consistency.

Example:
Consider a "students" table with columns student_id, first_name, and last_name. Here, student_id can be set as the primary key to ensure each student has a unique identifier.

Foreign Key:
A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a database table that establishes a link between the data in two tables. It creates a relationship between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table, forming a connection between the related data in both tables. Foreign keys are used to ensure referential integrity, meaning that values in the foreign key column must match the values in the referenced primary key column.

Example:
Assume we have a "courses" table with columns course_id, course_name, and a "students" table with columns student_id, first_name, last_name, and course_id as a foreign key. The course_id in the "students" table would refer to the course_id in the "courses" table, indicating which course each student is enrolled in.

In summary:

A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table.
A foreign key establishes a relationship between tables by linking the foreign key column in one table to the primary key column in another table.
Primary keys ensure uniqueness and data integrity within a table, while foreign keys maintain relationships between tables and ensure referential integrity.Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.Certainly! To connect MySQL to Python, you can use the mysql-connector library, which provides a convenient way to interact with MySQL databases. First, make sure you have the library installed by running:

pip install mysql-connector-python
Here's a Python code example that demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL database, use the cursor() method to create a cursor object, and then use the execute() method to run SQL queries:
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection to the MySQL database
db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="username",
    password="password",
    database="mydatabase"
)

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = db_connection.cursor()

# SQL query
query = "SELECT * FROM employees"

# Execute the query using the cursor
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the results using fetchall()
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Display the results
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and the database connection
cursor.close()
db_connection.close()
Explanation:

First, you import the mysql.connector module.
You establish a connection to the MySQL database using the mysql.connector.connect() method, providing the necessary connection details (host, user, password, and database).
You create a cursor object using the cursor() method on the database connection. The cursor is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results.
You define an SQL query using the query variable.
You use the execute() method on the cursor to run the SQL query.
You fetch the results using the fetchall() method, which retrieves all rows returned by the query.
You iterate through the results and print each row.
Finally, you close the cursor and the database connection to release resources.
The cursor() method creates a cursor object associated with the database connection. The execute() method is used on the cursor to run SQL queries. It takes an SQL query as an argument and sends it to the MySQL server for execution. The results of the query can be fetched using various methods like fetchall(), fetchone(), etc., depending on your needs.
Remember to replace "username", "password", "mydatabase", and the query with your actual database details and SQL query.Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query is as follows:

SELECT: This clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the database.

FROM: This clause specifies the table or tables from which you are retrieving the data.

WHERE: This optional clause is used to filter the rows based on specific conditions. It's applied after the data is retrieved from the specified table(s).

GROUP BY: This clause is used to group the rows based on specified columns. It's applied after the WHERE clause filters the rows.

HAVING: This optional clause is used to filter the groups created by the GROUP BY clause based on specific conditions.

ORDER BY: This clause is used to sort the rows based on specified columns. It's applied after all the previous clauses have been processed.

LIMIT/OFFSET: These optional clauses are used to restrict the number of rows returned (LIMIT) or to skip a certain number of rows (OFFSET).

The general structure of a SELECT statement follows this order, though not all clauses are required in every query. The WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, and LIMIT/OFFSET clauses are used to refine the results of the data selected by the SELECT and FROM clauses.
