# Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.
Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating population parameters (such as the mean, variance, proportion, etc.) based on sample data. It provides a way to make informed inferences about a population using information gathered from a sample of that population. There are two main types of estimation in statistics: point estimation and interval estimation.

Point Estimate:

Point estimation involves providing a single value, known as a point estimate, as the best guess for the population parameter of interest based on the sample data.
The point estimate is typically calculated using a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) and is used as an approximation of the true population parameter.
For example, if you want to estimate the average income of households in a city and you collect data from a sample of households, the sample mean income would be your point estimate for the population mean income.
Interval Estimate:

Interval estimation, also known as confidence interval estimation, provides a range of values (an interval) within which the true population parameter is likely to fall, along with a level of confidence.
Unlike point estimates, interval estimates account for the uncertainty inherent in statistical sampling.
A confidence interval is calculated based on the sample data and a chosen confidence level (e.g., 95% confidence interval).
The confidence level represents the probability that the true parameter falls within the interval.
For example, a 95% confidence interval for the average height of a population might be [160 cm, 170 cm]. This means we are 95% confident that the true average height of the population falls within this interval.
In summary, estimation statistics involves the use of point estimates to provide a single best guess for a population parameter and interval estimates to provide a range of values that likely contains the true parameter value with a specified level of confidence. Both point and interval estimates are essential tools for making inferences about populations based on sample data in statistics.

Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.
ChatGPT
Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in statistics used to make inferences about populations based on sample data. It is a formal process that involves evaluating and testing specific hypotheses or claims about population parameters. Hypothesis testing is widely used in scientific research, quality control, business decision-making, and various other fields to draw conclusions about the population from which a sample is drawn.

The primary steps involved in hypothesis testing are as follows:

Formulate Hypotheses:

The first step is to state a null hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ) and an alternative hypothesis (
�
1
H 
1
​
  or 
�
�
H 
A
​
 ). The null hypothesis typically represents a default assumption or a claim to be tested, while the alternative hypothesis represents a counterclaim or the effect you want to detect.
Collect and Analyze Data:

Collect sample data and analyze it to obtain relevant statistics (e.g., sample mean, sample standard deviation).
Calculate Test Statistic:

Compute a test statistic (e.g., t-statistic, z-score) based on the sample data and the null hypothesis.
Determine the Significance Level (
�
α):

Choose a significance level (
�
α) that represents the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). Common significance levels include 0.05 and 0.01.
Compare Test Statistic to Critical Value or P-value:

Depending on the type of hypothesis test, compare the calculated test statistic to a critical value from a statistical table or calculate a p-value.
If the test statistic falls in the critical region or the p-value is less than 
�
α, you reject the null hypothesis.
If the test statistic does not fall in the critical region or the p-value is greater than or equal to 
�
α, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Draw a Conclusion:

Based on the comparison in step 5, draw a conclusion regarding the null hypothesis. If you reject it, you may conclude in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If you fail to reject it, you do not have enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
The Importance of Hypothesis Testing:

Scientific Inquiry: Hypothesis testing is fundamental to the scientific method. It allows researchers to test hypotheses and make objective conclusions based on empirical evidence.

Decision-Making: In business and industry, hypothesis testing helps in decision-making processes, such as product quality control, marketing strategies, and process improvement. It provides a basis for data-driven decisions.

Quality Assurance: In manufacturing and quality control, hypothesis testing is used to ensure products meet predefined quality standards and specifications.

Medical Research: Hypothesis testing is crucial in medical research to determine the effectiveness of treatments and interventions.

Legal and Policy Implications: In legal cases and policy analysis, hypothesis testing can be used to determine whether evidence supports a claim or allegation.

Risk Assessment: It is used in assessing risks and making predictions about future outcomes in fields like finance and insurance.

Continuous Improvement: In Six Sigma and Lean methodologies, hypothesis testing is a key tool for process improvement and optimization.

In summary, hypothesis testing is a powerful statistical technique that helps us make informed decisions, draw conclusions, and assess the validity of claims based on empirical evidence. It plays a central role in the scientific and practical application of statistics.

# Q4. Create a hypothesis that states whether the average weight of male college students is greater than 
# the average weight of female college students.
Certainly, you can formulate a hypothesis to test whether the average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students. Here are the null and alternative hypotheses for this comparison:

Null Hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ):
The null hypothesis represents the default assumption and states that there is no significant difference in the average weight between male and female college students.

�
0
:
�
male
=
�
female
H 
0
​
 :μ 
male
​
 =μ 
female
​
 

In this null hypothesis:

�
male
μ 
male
​
  represents the population mean weight of male college students.
�
female
μ 
female
​
  represents the population mean weight of female college students.
Alternative Hypothesis (
�
1
H 
1
​
  or 
�
�
H 
A
​
 ):
The alternative hypothesis represents the claim or effect you want to test, and it states that the average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students.

�
1
:
�
male
>
�
female
H 
1
​
 :μ 
male
​
 >μ 
female
​
 

In this alternative hypothesis, 
�
male
>
�
female
μ 
male
​
 >μ 
female
​
  implies that the population mean weight of male college students is greater than the population mean weight of female college students.

You would then collect data on the weights of male and female college students and conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, based on the sample data. The choice of statistical test (e.g., t-test, z-test) and the significance level (
�
α) would depend on the specifics of your study and the data you collect.

# Q5. Write a Python script to conduct a hypothesis test on the difference between two population means, 
# given a sample from each population.

# In[2]:


# To conduct a hypothesis test on the difference between two population means using Python, you can use the scipy.stats library, which provides various statistical tests. In this example, I'll demonstrate how to perform an independent two-sample t-test, assuming you have two samples from the two populations. The steps include importing the necessary libraries, loading the data, and conducting the t-test.

# Here's a Python script to perform a two-sample t-test:
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Sample data from the first population (e.g., male college students)
sample1 = np.array([75, 80, 85, 90, 95])

# Sample data from the second population (e.g., female college students)
sample2 = np.array([65, 70, 75, 80, 85])

# Set the significance level (alpha)
alpha = 0.05

# Perform the two-sample t-test (assuming unequal variances)
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2, equal_var=False)

# Print the results
print("T-Statistic:", t_statistic)
print("P-Value:", p_value)

# Determine whether to reject the null hypothesis
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis")
    print("There is enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in means.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis")
    print("There is not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in means.")
# In this script:
# We import the necessary libraries, including numpy for data manipulation and scipy.stats for hypothesis testing.
# We define two sample arrays, sample1 and sample2, which represent the data from the two populations (e.g., weights of male and female college students).
# We set the significance level alpha (usually 0.05) to determine the threshold for statistical significance.
# We perform the two-sample t-test using stats.ttest_ind. The equal_var=False argument assumes that the variances in the two samples are not equal.
# We print the calculated t-statistic and p-value.
# Based on the p-value and the chosen significance level, we determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than alpha, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in means; otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
# Make sure to replace the sample1 and sample2 arrays with your actual sample data from the two populations to conduct the test on your specific data.

# Q6: What is a null and alternative hypothesis? Give some examples.
A null hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ) and an alternative hypothesis (
�
1
H 
1
​
  or 
�
�
H 
A
​
 ) are fundamental components of hypothesis testing in statistics. They are used to formulate and test claims or hypotheses about population parameters based on sample data. Here's an explanation of each, along with some examples:

Null Hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ):
The null hypothesis is a statement that represents the default or status quo assumption. It assumes that there is no significant effect, no difference, or no relationship in the population parameters being studied. It is typically denoted as 
�
0
H 
0
​
 .

Examples of null hypotheses:

Example 1 (Medical Research):
�
0
H 
0
​
 : There is no difference in blood pressure levels between patients who receive Drug A and those who receive a placebo.

Example 2 (Manufacturing):
�
0
H 
0
​
 : The mean diameter of manufactured ball bearings is equal to 10 millimeters.

Example 3 (Social Science):
�
0
H 
0
​
 : There is no association between education level and annual income.

Alternative Hypothesis (
�
1
H 
1
​
  or 
�
�
H 
A
​
 ):
The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents the claim or effect you want to test or detect in the population parameters. It can take different forms, depending on whether you're testing for a difference, a relationship, or an effect. It is typically denoted as 
�
1
H 
1
​
  or 
�
�
H 
A
​
 .

Examples of alternative hypotheses:

Example 1 (Medical Research):
�
1
H 
1
​
 : Patients who receive Drug A have a different average blood pressure level compared to those who receive a placebo.

Example 2 (Manufacturing):
�
�
H 
A
​
 : The mean diameter of manufactured ball bearings is not equal to 10 millimeters.

Example 3 (Social Science):
�
1
H 
1
​
 : There is a positive association between education level and annual income.

In hypothesis testing, the goal is to collect sample data and use statistical tests to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis is based on factors such as the calculated test statistic, the chosen significance level (
�
α), and the p-value obtained from the analysis. The choice of null and alternative hypotheses depends on the research question and the hypothesis you want to investigate.





# In[ ]:





# Q7: Write down the steps involved in hypothesis testing.

Hypothesis testing is a structured process used to make statistical inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The following are the general steps involved in hypothesis testing:

Formulate Hypotheses:

State a null hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ) and an alternative hypothesis (
�
1
H 
1
​
  or 
�
�
H 
A
​
 ). The null hypothesis represents the default assumption, while the alternative hypothesis represents the claim or effect you want to test.
Collect and Prepare Data:

Collect relevant data from the sample(s) that will be used in the hypothesis test. Ensure that the data is appropriately cleaned and organized for analysis.
Choose a Significance Level (
�
α):

Select the significance level, denoted as 
�
α, which represents the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). Common choices include 0.05 and 0.01.
Select a Statistical Test:

Choose an appropriate statistical test based on the research question, type of data, and the hypotheses being tested. Common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis, etc.
Calculate the Test Statistic:

Compute the test statistic based on the chosen statistical test and the sample data. The test statistic quantifies the difference or relationship between the sample data and what is expected under the null hypothesis.
Determine the Critical Region or Calculate P-value:

Depending on the test chosen, determine the critical region (rejection region) or calculate the p-value. The critical region defines the range of values for the test statistic that would lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining results as extreme as, or more extreme than, those observed if the null hypothesis were true.
Make a Decision:

Compare the calculated test statistic to the critical value(s) from a statistical table or the p-value.
If the test statistic falls in the critical region or the p-value is less than 
�
α, you reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
If the test statistic does not fall in the critical region or the p-value is greater than or equal to 
�
α, you fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
Draw a Conclusion:

Based on the decision in step 7, draw a conclusion about the null hypothesis. If you reject it, you may conclude in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If you fail to reject it, you do not have enough evidence to conclude in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
Interpret the Results:

Interpret the findings of the hypothesis test in the context of the research question. Explain the practical implications of the results.
Report and Document:

Document the entire hypothesis testing process, including the null and alternative hypotheses, the data used, the test statistic, the decision, and the interpretation. Report your findings in a clear and concise manner.
These steps help ensure that hypothesis testing is conducted systematically and rigorously, allowing for informed statistical inference based on empirical evidence.

# Q8. Define p-value and explain its significance in hypothesis testing.
The p-value, short for "probability value," is a crucial concept in hypothesis testing in statistics. It quantifies the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ) and helps determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on sample data. Here's a formal definition and an explanation of the significance of p-values:

Definition: The p-value is the probability of obtaining test results as extreme as, or more extreme than, those observed in the sample data when the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it measures the likelihood of observing the observed data or more extreme data points if the null hypothesis is correct.

Significance of the p-value in Hypothesis Testing:

The p-value plays a critical role in hypothesis testing for the following reasons:

Decision Rule: The p-value provides a decision rule for hypothesis testing. It helps you decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it. The decision rule is typically based on the chosen significance level (
�
α).

Interpretation: A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. If the p-value is very small (usually less than 
�
α), it suggests that the observed data is highly unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis is true, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.

Significance Level Comparison: By comparing the p-value to the significance level (
�
α), you can make a clear decision:

If p-value < 
�
α: Reject the null hypothesis. There is strong evidence against it.
If p-value ≥ 
�
α: Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to reject it.
Subjective Choice: The p-value allows researchers to make hypothesis testing decisions based on a predetermined level of significance (
�
α), which reflects the acceptable risk of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). Researchers can adjust the level of significance based on the desired level of confidence in their conclusions.

Continuous Interpretation: The p-value provides a continuous measure of evidence, allowing for gradations of significance. Smaller p-values indicate stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, while larger p-values suggest weaker evidence against it.

It's essential to note that the p-value is not a measure of the size of the effect or the practical importance of the findings. It only indicates the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis based on the sample data. Researchers should consider the context and practical implications of the results when interpreting the significance of their findings.

In summary, the p-value is a crucial tool in hypothesis testing, providing a standardized way to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis and make informed decisions about accepting or rejecting it. It offers a quantitative measure of the support or lack of support for alternative hypotheses based on sample data.

# Q11: What is Student’s t distribution? When to use the t-Distribution.
Student's t-distribution, often referred to as the t-distribution, is a probability distribution that is similar in shape to the normal distribution but has heavier tails. It is a fundamental statistical distribution used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation when dealing with small sample sizes and situations where the population standard deviation is unknown.

Key characteristics of the t-distribution:

Shape: The t-distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, like the normal distribution. However, it has thicker tails, which means it has more probability in the tails compared to the normal distribution.

Parameter: The t-distribution depends on a parameter called degrees of freedom (df), which determines the shape of the distribution. As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the shape of the normal distribution.

When to use the t-Distribution:

The t-distribution is used in various statistical applications, particularly when certain conditions are met:

Small Sample Sizes: When dealing with small sample sizes (typically n < 30), the t-distribution is preferred over the normal distribution. In small samples, sample statistics (e.g., sample mean and sample standard deviation) may not provide accurate estimates of population parameters, and the t-distribution accounts for this uncertainty.

Unknown Population Standard Deviation: When the population standard deviation (
�
σ) is unknown, the t-distribution is used in place of the normal distribution. In practice, it's often the case that the population standard deviation is not known, and the sample standard deviation (
�
s) is used instead.

Hypothesis Testing: The t-distribution is commonly used in hypothesis testing, especially for comparing sample means, conducting t-tests (e.g., one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test), and assessing the significance of differences or relationships in small samples.

Confidence Intervals: When constructing confidence intervals for population parameters (e.g., population mean), the t-distribution is used, particularly when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown.

Quality Control: In quality control and process improvement, the t-distribution is used to analyze and make decisions about the quality of manufactured products when dealing with limited sample sizes.

In summary, the t-distribution is a valuable statistical tool for situations where sample sizes are small, the population standard deviation is unknown, and accurate statistical inference is required. It is a critical component of hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and various statistical analyses in practice.

# Q12: What is t-statistic? State the formula for t-statistic.
The t-statistic, also known as the t-value, is a statistical measure used in hypothesis testing to assess whether the difference between a sample statistic and a population parameter is statistically significant. It quantifies how many standard errors the sample statistic is away from the population parameter under the null hypothesis. The t-statistic is used primarily in cases where the population standard deviation is unknown, and sample data are used to estimate it.

The formula for the t-statistic for a one-sample t-test is as follows:

�
=
�
ˉ
−
�
�
/
�
t= 
s/ 
n
​
 
x
ˉ
 −μ
​
 

Where:

�
ˉ
x
ˉ
  is the sample mean.
�
μ is the hypothesized population mean under the null hypothesis.
�
s is the sample standard deviation.
�
n is the sample size.
Here's a breakdown of the components of the formula:

�
ˉ
−
�
x
ˉ
 −μ: This is the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean. It measures how far the sample mean deviates from the null hypothesis.

�
/
�
s/ 
n
​
 : This is the standard error of the sample mean, which quantifies the variability of the sample mean. It is the standard deviation of the sample (
�
s) divided by the square root of the sample size (
�
n). It reflects the precision of the sample mean estimate.

The t-statistic measures how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the population mean, taking into account the sample size and sample standard deviation. A larger absolute value of the t-statistic suggests a larger difference between the sample mean and the population mean, which may lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis if the t-statistic is significantly different from zero.

In hypothesis testing, you compare the calculated t-statistic to critical values from the t-distribution or calculate a p-value to determine whether the observed difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean is statistically significant, leading to the decision to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

# Q13. A coffee shop owner wants to estimate the average daily revenue for their shop. They take a random 
# sample of 50 days and find the sample mean revenue to be  500 with a standard deviation of  50. 
# Estimate the population mean revenue with a 95% confidence interval.
To estimate the population mean revenue with a 95% confidence interval, you can use the formula for the confidence interval for the mean when the population standard deviation is unknown. The formula is:

Confidence Interval
=
�
ˉ
±
(
�
⋅
�
�
)
Confidence Interval= 
x
ˉ
 ±( 
n
​
 
t⋅s
​
 )

Where:

�
ˉ
x
ˉ
  is the sample mean (500 in this case).
�
t is the critical t-value for the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom. For a 95% confidence interval and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1), you can find this value from a t-table or calculator.
�
s is the sample standard deviation (50 in this case).
�
n is the sample size (50 in this case).
First, let's find the critical t-value for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom. You can use a t-table or a calculator for this purpose. For a 95% confidence level and 49 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value is approximately 2.0096 (rounded to four decimal places).

Now, plug the values into the formula:

Confidence Interval
=
500
±
(
2.0096
⋅
50
50
)
Confidence Interval=500±( 
50
​
 
2.0096⋅50
​
 )

Calculate the values inside the parentheses:

Confidence Interval
=
500
±
(
100.48
50
)
Confidence Interval=500±( 
50
​
 
100.48
​
 )

Now, calculate the standard error:

Standard Error
=
100.48
50
≈
14.24
Standard Error= 
50
​
 
100.48
​
 ≈14.24

Finally, calculate the confidence interval:

Confidence Interval
=
500
±
14.24
Confidence Interval=500±14.24

So, the 95% confidence interval for the average daily revenue for the coffee shop is approximately:

500
±
14.24
500±14.24

This means you can be 95% confident that the true population mean daily revenue falls within the range of $485.76 to $514.24.

# Q14. A researcher hypothesizes that a new drug will decrease blood pressure by 10 mmHg. They conduct a 
# clinical trial with 100 patients and find that the sample mean decrease in blood pressure is 8 mmHg with a 
# standard deviation of 3 mmHg. Test the hypothesis with a significance level of 0.05.
To test the hypothesis that the new drug decreases blood pressure by 10 mmHg, you can perform a one-sample t-test. Here are the steps to conduct the test with a significance level of 0.05:

Step 1: Define the Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ): The new drug does not decrease blood pressure by 10 mmHg; in other words, the population mean decrease in blood pressure (
�
μ) is equal to 10 mmHg.
Alternative Hypothesis (
�
1
H 
1
​
  or 
�
�
H 
A
​
 ): The new drug decreases blood pressure by 10 mmHg; 
�
μ is not equal to 10 mmHg.
Step 2: Collect and Prepare Data:

Sample Mean (
�
ˉ
x

 ) = 8 mmHg
Sample Standard Deviation (
�
s) = 3 mmHg
Sample Size (
�
n) = 100
Step 3: Set the Significance Level:

Significance Level (
�
α) = 0.05
Step 4: Calculate the Test Statistic:

The formula for the one-sample t-test statistic is:

​

Step 5: Determine the Critical Value or p-Value:

Since it's a two-tailed test, we'll find the critical t-values for a significance level of 0.05/2 = 0.025. You can use a t-table or a calculator for this. In this case, the critical t-values for a 0.025 significance level with 99 degrees of freedom are approximately ±1.984 (rounded to three decimal places).
Step 6: Make a Decision:

Compare the calculated t-statistic (-6.67) with the critical t-values (-1.984 and 1.984).
If the t-statistic falls outside the range (-1.984 to 1.984), we reject the null hypothesis.
Otherwise, if the t-statistic is within the range, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Step 7: Draw a Conclusion:

The calculated t-statistic (-6.67) is well beyond the critical t-values (-1.984 to 1.984).
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.
Step 8: Interpret the Results:

There is enough evidence to conclude that the new drug decreases blood pressure by more than 10 mmHg because the sample mean decrease in blood pressure is significantly different from 10 mmHg at the 0.05 significance level.
In summary, the results of the one-sample t-test suggest that the new drug has a statistically significant effect on reducing blood pressure, with a sample mean decrease of 8 mmHg.

# Q15. An electronics company produces a certain type of product with a mean weight of 5 pounds and a 
# standard deviation of 0.5 pounds. A random sample of 25 products is taken, and the sample mean weight 
# is found to be 4.8 pounds. Test the hypothesis that the true mean weight of the products is less than 5 
# pounds with a significance level of 0.01.
To test the hypothesis that the true mean weight of the products is less than 5 pounds, you can perform a one-sample t-test for a population mean. Here are the steps to conduct the test with a significance level of 0.01:

Step 1: Define the Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (

Step 2: Collect and Prepare Data:

Population Mean (

Step 5: Determine the Critical Value or p-Value:

Since it's a one-tailed test (less than), we'll find the critical t-value for a significance level of 0.01 with 24 degrees of freedom. You can use a t-table or a calculator for this. For a one-tailed test at the 0.01 significance level with 24 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value is approximately -2.492 (rounded to three decimal places).
Step 6: Make a Decision:

Compare the calculated t-statistic (-2) with the critical t-value (-2.492).
If the t-statistic is less than the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis.
If the t-statistic is greater than or equal to the critical t-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Step 7: Draw a Conclusion:

The calculated t-statistic (-2) is less than the critical t-value (-2.492).
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.
Step 8: Interpret the Results:

There is enough evidence to conclude that the true mean weight of the products is less than 5 pounds at the 0.01 significance level.
In summary, based on the results of the one-sample t-test, there is sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the true mean weight of the products is less than 5 pounds, with a sample mean weight of 4.8 pounds.

Step 6: Make a Decision:

Compare the calculated t-statistic (2.257) with the critical t-values (-2.614 and 2.614).
If the t-statistic falls outside the range (-2.614 to 2.614), we reject the null hypothesis.
Otherwise, if the t-statistic is within the range, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Step 7: Draw a Conclusion:

The calculated t-statistic (2.257) falls within the range (-2.614 to 2.614).
Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Step 8: Interpret the Results:

Based on the results of the independent two-sample t-test, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the population means for the two groups are different at the 0.01 significance level.
In summary, the test does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the population means for the two groups are not equal.

# Q17. A marketing company wants to estimate the average number of ads watched by viewers during a TV 
# program. They take a random sample of 50 viewers and find that the sample mean is 4 with a standard 
# deviation of 1.5. Estimate the population mean with a 99% confidence interval
To estimate the population mean with a 99% confidence interval, you can use the formula for the confidence interval for the mean when the population standard deviation is unknown. The formula is:

Confidence Interval

�
ˉ
±
(
�
⋅

)
Confidence Interval=

ˉ
 ±(

​
 
t⋅s
​
 )

Where:

�
ˉ
x
ˉ
  is the sample mean (4 in this case).
�
t is the critical t-value for the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom. For a 99% confidence interval and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1), you can find this value from a t-table or calculator.
�
s is the sample standard deviation (1.5 in this case).
�
n is the sample size (50 in this case).
First, let's find the critical t-value for a 99% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom. You can use a t-table or a calculator for this purpose. For a 99% confidence level and 49 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value is approximately ±2.677 (rounded to three decimal places).

Now, plug the values into the formula:

Confidence Interval
=
4
±
(
2.677
⋅
1.5
50
)
Confidence Interval=4±(

Calculate the values inside the parentheses:

±
(
4.0155

)
Confidence Interval=4±(

​
 
4.0155

Now, calculate the standard error:

≈
0.5684
Standard Error=

​
 ≈0.5684

Finally, calculate the confidence interval:

Confidence Interval
=

±
0.5684
Confidence Interval=4±0.5684

So, the 99% confidence interval for the average number of ads watched by viewers during the TV program is approximately:

4
±
0.5684
4±0.5684

This means you can be 99% confident that the true population mean number of ads watched by viewers falls within the range of approximately 3.4316 to 4.5684.
