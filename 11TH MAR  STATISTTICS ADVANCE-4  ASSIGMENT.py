# Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would 
# use each type of test.
A t-test and a z-test are both statistical hypothesis tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data, but they are applied in different situations and have some key differences:

Sample Size:

t-test: It is typically used when the sample size is small (usually less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.
z-test: It is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known.
Standard Deviation:

t-test: It assumes that the population standard deviation is unknown and estimates it from the sample data.
z-test: It requires knowledge of the population standard deviation.
Distribution:

t-test: It uses the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the normal distribution. The shape of the t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, which is related to the sample size.
z-test: It uses the standard normal distribution (z-distribution), which has a fixed shape with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
Hypotheses:

Both tests are used to test hypotheses about population means (e.g., comparing a sample mean to a known or hypothesized population mean).
Here are example scenarios for when you might use each type of test:

Scenario 1: t-test
Suppose you want to test whether a new weight loss program is effective in reducing the weight of a small group of participants (n < 30). You collect weight measurements from 20 participants before they start the program and after they complete it. You can use a paired two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two paired samples (before and after the program). In this case, you use the t-test because the sample size is small, and you don't know the population standard deviation.

Scenario 2: z-test
Imagine you are conducting a survey to determine if the average income of software developers in a large city is significantly different from the national average income (which is known). You collect data from a large random sample of 200 software developers in the city. Since your sample size is relatively large, and you know the population standard deviation (the national average income), you can use a z-test to compare the sample mean to the known population mean.

In summary, choose a t-test when you have a small sample size and don't know the population standard deviation, and opt for a z-test when you have a large sample size or when you know the population standard deviation. The choice of test depends on the specific characteristics of your data and research question.

# Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.
One-tailed and two-tailed tests are two types of hypothesis tests used in statistics to make inferences about population parameters. They differ in how they evaluate the relationship between the sample data and the null hypothesis. Here's how they differ:

One-Tailed Test:

Directionality: In a one-tailed test, you have a specific directional hypothesis. You are interested in testing whether the population parameter is greater than or less than a certain value, but not both simultaneously. This directionality is also known as a "one-sided" test.

Critical Region: For a one-tailed test, the critical region (the region of extreme values that would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis) is located on only one side of the sampling distribution (either the right side or the left side). Which side depends on the specific directional hypothesis.

Example: Suppose you want to test whether a new drug increases the average response time for a cognitive task. Your null hypothesis (H0) might be that the drug has no effect or decreases response time (μ ≤ μ0), and your alternative hypothesis (Ha) would be that the drug increases response time (μ > μ0). This is a one-tailed test because you are only interested in detecting an increase in response time.

Two-Tailed Test:

Directionality: In a two-tailed test, you do not have a specific directional hypothesis. Instead, you are interested in whether the population parameter is different from a certain value in either direction (greater or less than). This is also known as a "two-sided" test.

Critical Region: For a two-tailed test, the critical region is divided into two equal parts, one on each side of the sampling distribution. This accounts for the possibility of the population parameter being either significantly greater or significantly less than the hypothesized value.

Example: Consider a scenario where you want to test whether a coin is fair, i.e., whether it has an equal probability of landing heads (H) or tails (T). Your null hypothesis (H0) would be that the coin is fair (p = 0.5), and your alternative hypothesis (Ha) would be that the coin is not fair (p ≠ 0.5). This is a two-tailed test because you are interested in deviations from fairness in either direction.

In summary, the choice between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test depends on your research question and the specific hypothesis you want to test. If you have a specific directional expectation, use a one-tailed test. If you want to detect differences in either direction without a specific expectation, use a two-tailed test.

# Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for 
# each type of error.
In hypothesis testing, Type I and Type II errors are two types of mistakes that can occur when making decisions about a null hypothesis (H0) based on sample data. These errors are related to the correctness of the decision made during hypothesis testing:

Type I Error (False Positive or Alpha Error):

Definition: A Type I error occurs when you incorrectly reject a null hypothesis that is actually true. In other words, you conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when there isn't one in reality.
Symbolically: Type I error is denoted by α (alpha).
Example Scenario: Suppose you are testing a new drug's effectiveness for reducing cholesterol levels. Your null hypothesis (H0) is that the drug has no effect on cholesterol levels. However, due to random variability in the data or a small sample size, you mistakenly find a significant reduction in cholesterol levels and reject H0 when, in fact, the drug has no real effect.
Type II Error (False Negative or Beta Error):

Definition: A Type II error occurs when you incorrectly fail to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. In other words, you conclude that there is no significant effect or difference when there is one in reality.
Symbolically: Type II error is denoted by β (beta).
Example Scenario: Consider a quality control scenario where you are testing whether a manufacturing process produces defective products less than 5% of the time. Your null hypothesis (H0) is that the process meets the quality standard. However, due to sample variability or measurement errors, you fail to detect a significant number of defects, and you do not reject H0 when the process is, in fact, producing a higher percentage of defective products.
In summary:

Type I Error is the error of concluding something is significant when it's not (false positive).
Type II Error is the error of failing to detect significance when it actually exists (false negative).
These errors are inversely related, meaning that reducing the probability of one type of error typically increases the probability of the other. Researchers often choose a significance level (alpha, α) in advance to control the risk of Type I errors. The choice of significance level (commonly set at 0.05 or 0.01) affects the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing. Lowering alpha reduces the risk of Type I errors but increases the risk of Type II errors, and vice versa. The goal is to strike a balance that aligns with the research's objectives and the potential consequences of making each type of error.

# Q4:  Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.
Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It is particularly useful in situations where you want to calculate the probability of an event or hypothesis given some observed data. Bayes's theorem is expressed mathematically as follows:

�
(
�
∣
�
)
=
�
(
�
∣
�
)
⋅
�
(
�
)
�
(
�
)
P(A∣B)= 
P(B)
P(B∣A)⋅P(A)
​
 

Where:

�
(
�
∣
�
)
P(A∣B) is the probability of hypothesis A being true given the evidence B (this is called the posterior probability).
�
(
�
∣
�
)
P(B∣A) is the probability of observing evidence B given that hypothesis A is true (this is called the likelihood).
�
(
�
)
P(A) is the prior probability of hypothesis A being true, before considering any evidence.
�
(
�
)
P(B) is the probability of observing evidence B, regardless of the hypothesis.
Let's illustrate Bayes's theorem with a simple example:

Example: Medical Diagnosis

Imagine a medical scenario where a patient is being tested for a rare disease. Let's define the following probabilities:

�
(
�
)
P(D): The prior probability that the patient has the disease, which is very low because the disease is rare (let's say 0.01 or 1%).
�
(
¬
�
)
P(¬D): The prior probability that the patient does not have the disease, which is 1 minus the probability of having the disease (0.99 or 99%).
�
(
+
∣
�
)
P(+∣D): The probability of testing positive given that the patient has the disease, which is the sensitivity of the test (let's say 0.95 or 95%).
�
(
−
∣
�
)
P(−∣D): The probability of testing negative given that the patient has the disease, which is 1 minus the sensitivity (0.05 or 5%).
�
(
+
∣
¬
�
)
P(+∣¬D): The probability of testing positive given that the patient does not have the disease, which is the false positive rate (let's say 0.10 or 10%).
�
(
−
∣
¬
�
)
P(−∣¬D): The probability of testing negative given that the patient does not have the disease, which is 1 minus the false positive rate (0.90 or 90%).
Now, suppose a patient undergoes the test and tests positive (B+). We want to calculate the probability that the patient actually has the disease (A = D).

Using Bayes's theorem:

�
(
�
∣
�
+
)
=
�
(
�
+
∣
�
)
⋅
�
(
�
)
�
(
�
+
)
P(D∣B+)= 
P(B+)
P(B+∣D)⋅P(D)
​
 

To calculate 
�
(
�
+
)
P(B+) in the denominator, we can use the law of total probability:

�
(
�
+
)
=
�
(
�

∣
�
)
⋅
�
(
�
)
+
�
(
�
+
∣
¬
�
)
⋅
�
(
¬
�
)
P(B+)=P(B+∣D)⋅P(D)+P(B+∣¬D)⋅P(¬D)

Now, we can plug in the values and calculate 
�
(
�
∣
�
+
)
P(D∣B+):

�
(
�
∣
�
+
)
=
0.95
⋅
0.01
0.95
⋅
0.01
+
0.10
⋅
0.99
P(D∣B+)= 
0.95⋅0.01+0.10⋅0.99
0.95⋅0.01
​
 

Calculating this expression yields the posterior probability that the patient has the disease given the positive test result. This is an example of how Bayes's theorem can be used to update probabilities based on new evidence, such as medical test results.

# Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.
A confidence interval is a range of values that is calculated from a sample of data and is used to estimate an unknown population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides a range of plausible values for the parameter, along with a confidence level that quantifies the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimate.

Here's how to calculate a confidence interval with an example:

Step 1: Collect Data and Choose a Confidence Level

First, you collect a sample of data from the population of interest. Then, you choose a confidence level, which is typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95%, 99%). A 95% confidence level is commonly used, indicating that you are 95% confident that the true population parameter falls within the calculated interval.

Step 2: Calculate the Sample Mean and Standard Error

Calculate the sample mean (
�
ˉ
X
ˉ
 ) and the standard error (
�
�
SE) of the sample. The standard error is a measure of the variability of sample means and is typically calculated as the sample standard deviation (
�
s) divided by the square root of the sample size (
�
n).

�
�
=
�
�
SE= 
n
​
 
s
​
 

Step 3: Determine the Critical Value

Determine the critical value from a standard normal distribution (z-table) or other appropriate distribution, depending on your sample size and distribution type. For a 95% confidence interval using a standard normal distribution, the critical value (
�
�
/
2
z 
α/2
​
 ) is approximately 1.96 (for a two-tailed interval).

Step 4: Calculate the Margin of Error

Calculate the margin of error (
�
�
�
MOE), which is the product of the critical value and the standard error:

�
�
�
=
�
�
/
2
⋅
�
�
MOE=z 
α/2
​
 ⋅SE

Step 5: Calculate the Confidence Interval

The confidence interval is calculated by subtracting and adding the margin of error to the sample mean:

�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�

�
�
�
 to 
�
ˉ
+
�
�
�
ConfidenceInterval= 
X
ˉ
 −MOE to  
X
ˉ
 +MOE

Example:

Suppose you want to estimate the average height of adult males in a city. You collect a random sample of 100 adult males and find that the sample mean height (
�
ˉ
X
ˉ
 ) is 175 cm, and the sample standard deviation (
�
s) is 5 cm. You choose a 95% confidence level.

Calculate the standard error (
�
�
SE):
�
�
=
5
100
=
0.5
SE= 
100
​
 
5
​
 =0.5

Determine the critical value (
�
�
/
2
z 
α/2
​
 ) for a 95% confidence interval, which is approximately 1.96 for a standard normal distribution.

Calculate the margin of error (
�
�
�
MOE):

�
�
�
=
1.96
⋅
0.5
=
0.98
MOE=1.96⋅0.5=0.98

Calculate the confidence interval:
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
=
175
−
0.98
 to 
175
+
0.98
ConfidenceInterval=175−0.98 to 175+0.98

So, the 95% confidence interval for the average height of adult males in the city is approximately 
174.02
174.02 cm to 
175.98
175.98 cm. This means that you are 95% confident that the true average height falls within this interval.

# Q6. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the 
# event's probability and new evidence. Provide a sample problem and solution.
Certainly! Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the event's probability and new evidence.

(

P(B∣A) is the probability of observing evidence B given that event A has occurred (the likelihood).
�
(

)
P(A) is the prior probability of event A occurring before considering evidence B.
�
(

)
P(B) is the probability of observing evidence B regardless of whether event A has occurred.
Sample Problem: Medical Diagnosis

Let's say we have a medical test for a rare disease, and we want to calculate the probability that a patient has the disease (A) given a positive test result (B+). We have the following information:

The prior probability of having the disease, 
�
(
�
)
P(A), is 0.02 (2% of the population has the disease).
The sensitivity of the test, 
�
(
�

)
P(B+∣A), is 0.95 (95% of true positives).
The false positive rate, 
�
(
�

)
P(B+∣¬A), is 0.08 (8% of false positives).
We want to calculate 
�
(
�
∣
�

)
P(A∣B+), the probability that the patient has the disease given a positive test result.

Solution:

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate

P(A∣B+):

P(A∣B+)=

P(B+∣A)⋅P(A)
​
 

First, calculate the denominator

P(B+) using the law of total probability:

P(B+)=P(B+∣A)⋅P(A)+P(B+∣¬A)⋅P(¬A)

�
(
¬
�
)
P(¬A) is the probability of not having the disease, which is 
1
−
�
(
�
)
1−P(A).
Now, plug in the values:

�
(

)
=
(
0.95

0.02
)
+
(
0.08
⋅
0.98

P(B+)=(0.95⋅0.02)+(0.08⋅0.98)

�
(

)
=
0.019
+
0.0784
=
0.0974
P(B+)=0.019+0.0784=0.0974

Now, we can calculate

(

P(A∣B+) using Bayes' Theorem:

So, given a positive test result, the probability that the patient actually has the disease is approximately 19.5%. This demonstrates how Bayes' Theorem can be used to update the probability of an event (having the disease) based on new evidence (a positive test result) and prior knowledge.

# Q7. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation 
# of 5. Interpret the results
To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, you can use the formula for a confidence interval when the population standard deviation is known. The formula is:

Confidence Interval
=
�
ˉ
±
�
⋅
(
�
�
)
Confidence Interval= 
X
ˉ
 ±Z⋅( 
n
​

​
 )

Where:

�
ˉ
X
ˉ
  is the sample mean (given as 50).
�
Z is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence interval, 
�
Z is approximately 1.96.
�
σ is the population standard deviation (given as 5).
�
n is the sample size (which is not provided in the question).
Since you haven't provided the sample size (
�
n), I'll calculate the confidence interval assuming a sample size of 30 as a common choice. You can adjust the formula for the actual sample size if it's different.

Substituting the values into the formula:

Confidence Interval
=
50
±
1.96
⋅
(
5
30
)
Confidence Interval=50±1.96⋅( 
30
​

​
 )

Now, calculate the standard error:

Standard Error
=
5
30
≈
0.9129
Standard Error= 
30
​
 
5
​
 ≈0.9129

Now, calculate the confidence interval:

Lower Limit: 
50
−
1.96
⋅
0.9129
≈
50
−
1.7914
≈
48.2086
50−1.96⋅0.9129≈50−1.7914≈48.2086

Upper Limit: 
50
+
1.96
⋅
0.9129
≈
50
+
1.7914
≈
51.7914
50+1.96⋅0.9129≈50+1.7914≈51.7914

So, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, based on the provided sample data, is approximately 48.2086 to 51.7914.

Interpretation:

You can interpret the confidence interval as follows: "We are 95% confident that the true population mean lies within the range of 48.2086 to 51.7914." This means that if you were to take many samples and calculate their 95% confidence intervals in the same way, you would expect about 95% of those intervals to contain the true population mean. It provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with estimating the population mean based on your sample.

# Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect the margin of error? 
# Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.
The margin of error (MOE) in a confidence interval is a measure of the uncertainty or variability associated with estimating a population parameter (such as a mean or proportion) from a sample of data. It represents the range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence. The margin of error is typically denoted as 
�
�
�
MOE.

The formula for calculating the margin of error in a confidence interval depends on several factors, including the sample size (
�
n), the standard deviation (
�
σ or 
�
s), and the desired level of confidence. For a given level of confidence, a larger sample size generally leads to a smaller margin of error.

The relationship between sample size and margin of error can be expressed as follows:

�
�
�
∝
1
�
MOE∝ 
n
​
 
1
​
 

In other words, as the sample size (
�
n) increases, the margin of error (
�
�
�
MOE) decreases. This is because larger samples provide more information about the population, leading to more precise estimates of the population parameter.

Example:

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose you want to estimate the average score of students in a large university, and you are interested in a 95% confidence interval. You have two scenarios:

Scenario 1 - Smaller Sample Size: You take a random sample of 50 students and calculate the 95% confidence interval for their average score. The margin of error is approximately 3 points.

Scenario 2 - Larger Sample Size: In this scenario, you take a random sample of 500 students and calculate the 95% confidence interval for their average score. The margin of error is approximately 0.95 points.

Comparing the two scenarios, you can see that in Scenario 2 (with the larger sample size), the margin of error is smaller (0.95 points) compared to Scenario 1 (with the smaller sample size and a margin of error of 3 points). This means that with a larger sample size, you have a more precise estimate of the average score, and you can be more confident that the true population average falls within a narrower range.

In summary, the margin of error in a confidence interval quantifies the uncertainty in estimating a population parameter. Increasing the sample size typically leads to a smaller margin of error, which means you have a more precise estimate of the parameter and greater confidence in its accuracy

# Q9. Calculate the z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population

Where:

�
Z is the z-score.
�
X is the value of the data point (given as 75).

σ is the population standard deviation (given as 5).

​
 =

5
​
 =1

The z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5 is 1.

Interpretation:

The z-score tells you how many standard deviations the data point (75) is away from the population mean (70). In this case, a z-score of 1 means that the data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean. This indicates that the value of 75 is relatively higher than the average value in the population, and it provides a standardized measure of how far it deviates from the mean.

# Q10. In a study of the effectiveness of a new weight loss drug, a sample of 50 participants lost an average 
# of 6 pounds with a standard deviation of 2.5 pounds. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the drug is 
# significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test.
To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the weight loss drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test, you need to set up the null and alternative hypotheses and perform the test. Here's how you can do it step by step:

Step 1: Formulate the Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ): The weight loss drug is not significantly effective, meaning that the population mean weight loss (
�
μ) is equal to or less than 0 pounds.

H

Alternative Hypothesis (

�
�
:

​
 :μ>0
Step 2: Set the Significance Level

In this case, you want to test the hypothesis at a 95% confidence level, which corresponds to a significance level (
�
α) of 0.05.

Step 3: Collect and Analyze Data

You have the following data:

Sample size (

n) = 50
Sample mean (

​
 ≈7.66

Step 5: Determine the Critical Value

Since this is a one-tailed test (testing if the drug is significantly effective, which is a directional hypothesis), you need to find the critical t-value at a 95% confidence level with 49 degrees of freedom (
�
−
1
=
50
−
1
=
49
n−1=50−1=49). You can find this value using a t-table or a calculator. For a 95% confidence level and 49 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value is approximately 1.676.

Step 6: Make a Decision

Compare the calculated t-statistic (7.66) to the critical t-value (1.676):

If 
�
>
1.676
t>1.676, you can reject the null hypothesis.
If 
�
≤
1.676
t≤1.676, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
In this case, 7.66 is significantly greater than 1.676. Therefore, you can reject the null hypothesis.

Step 7: Draw a Conclusion

Based on the analysis, at a 95% confidence level, there is enough evidence to conclude that the weight loss drug is significantly effective in helping participants lose weight, as the sample mean weight loss is significantly greater than 0 pounds.

# Q11. In a survey of 500 people, 65% reported being satisfied with their current job. Calculate the 95% 
# confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job
To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job, you can use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion. The formula is:

Confidence Interval

�
Confidence Interval=

Where:

�
^
p

​
  is the sample proportion (given as 65%, which is 0.65 when expressed as a decimal).
�
Z is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence interval, 
�
Z is approximately 1.96.
�
n is the sample size (given as 500).
Now, plug in the values:

Confidence Interval

​
 

Confidence Interval
=
0.65
±
1.96
⋅
0.02133
Confidence Interval=0.65±1.96⋅0.02133

Now, calculate the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval:

Lower Limit: 
0.65
−
1.96
⋅
0.02133
≈
0.65
−
0.0418
≈
0.6082
0.65−1.96⋅0.02133≈0.65−0.0418≈0.6082

Upper Limit: 
0.65
+
1.96
⋅
0.02133
≈
0.65
+
0.0418
≈
0.6918
0.65+1.96⋅0.02133≈0.65+0.0418≈0.6918

So, the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job is approximately 60.82% to 69.18%. This means that we are 95% confident that the true proportion of people satisfied with their job falls within this interval based on the sample data.

To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there is a significant difference in student performance between the two teaching methods, you can use a two-sample t-test. Here are the steps to perform this test:

Step 1: Formulate the Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ): The two teaching methods have no significant difference in student performance, meaning that the population means (

Step 2: Set the Significance Level

In this case, you want to test the hypothesis at a significance level (
�
α) of 0.01.

Step 3: Collect and Analyze Data

You have the following data for the two samples:

Sample A:

Sample mean (
�
ˉ
1
X
ˉ
  
1
​
 ) = 85
Sample standard deviation (
�

​
 ) = 6
Sample size (

​
 ) is not provided.
Sample B:

Sample mean (

​
 ) = 82
Sample standard deviation (
�
2
s 
2
​
 ) = 5
Sample size (
�
2
n 
2
​
 ) is not provided.
Step 4: Perform the t-Test

To perform the t-test, you need the sample sizes (
�
1
n 
1
​
  and 
�
2
n 
2
​
 ) for both samples. Without this information, you cannot calculate the t-statistic or conduct the test.

Please provide the values for

# Q13. A population has a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 8. A sample of 50 observations has a mean 
# of 65. Calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean.
To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean based on the sample mean and the given population parameters, you can use the formula for a confidence interval when the population standard deviation is known:

Confidence Interval
=
�
ˉ
±
�
⋅
(
�
�
)
Confidence Interval= 
X
ˉ
 ±Z⋅( 
n
​
 
σ
​
 )

Where:

�
ˉ
X
ˉ
  is the sample mean (given as 65).
�
Z is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 90% confidence interval, 
�
Z is approximately 1.645.
�
σ is the population standard deviation (given as 8).
�
n is the sample size (given as 50).
Now, plug in the values:

Confidence Interval
=
65
±
1.645
⋅
(
8
50
)
Confidence Interval=65±1.645⋅( 
50
​
 
8
​
 )

Now, calculate the standard error:

Standard Error
=
8
50
≈
1.1314
Standard Error= 
50
​
 
8
​
 ≈1.1314

Now, calculate the confidence interval:

Lower Limit: 
65
−
1.645
⋅
1.1314
≈
65
−
1.8626
≈
63.1374
65−1.645⋅1.1314≈65−1.8626≈63.1374

Upper Limit: 
65
+
1.645
⋅
1.1314
≈
65
+
1.8626
≈
66.8626
65+1.645⋅1.1314≈65+1.8626≈66.8626

So, the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean is approximately 63.1374 to 66.8626. This means that we are 90% confident that the true population mean falls within this interval based on the sample data.

# Q14. In a study of the effects of caffeine on reaction time, a sample of 30 participants had an average 
# reaction time of 0.25 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test to 
# determine if the caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level using a t-test.
To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level using a t-test, you need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Formulate the Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ): Caffeine has no significant effect on reaction time, meaning that the population mean reaction time (
�
μ) with caffeine is equal to the population mean reaction time without caffeine.

�
0
:
�
with caffeine
=
�
without caffeine
H 
0
​
 :μ 
with caffeine
​
 =μ 
without caffeine
​
 
Alternative Hypothesis (
�
�
H 
a
​
 ): Caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time, meaning that the population mean reaction time with caffeine is different from the population mean reaction time without caffeine.

�
�
:
�
with caffeine
≠
�
without caffeine
H 
a
​
 :μ 
with caffeine
​
 

=μ 
without caffeine
​
 
Step 2: Set the Significance Level

In this case, you want to test the hypothesis at a 90% confidence level, which corresponds to a significance level (
�
α) of 0.10 (since the confidence level is 90%, the complement is 
1
−
0.90
=
0.10
1−0.90=0.10).

Step 3: Collect and Analyze Data

You have the following data for the sample with caffeine:

Sample size (
�
n) = 30
Sample mean (
�
ˉ
X
ˉ
 ) = 0.25 seconds
Sample standard deviation (
�
s) = 0.05 seconds
Step 4: Perform the t-Test

Calculate the t-statistic using the formula for a one-sample t-test:

�
=
�
ˉ
−
�
0
�
�
t= 
n
​
 
s
​
 
X
ˉ
 −μ 
0
​
 
​
 

Where:

�
ˉ
X
ˉ
  is the sample mean.
�
0
μ 
0
​
  is the hypothesized population mean under the null hypothesis (
�
without caffeine
μ 
without caffeine
​
 ).
�
s is the sample standard deviation.
�
n is the sample size.
Substitute the values into the formula:

�
=
0.25
−
�
without caffeine
0.05
30
t= 
30
​
 
0.05
​
 
0.25−μ 
without caffeine
​
 
​
 

Step 5: Determine the Critical Value

Since this is a two-tailed test (testing if caffeine has any effect, which is a non-directional hypothesis), you need to find the critical t-values at a 90% confidence level and degrees of freedom (
�
�
df) equal to 
�
−
1
n−1, which is 
30
−
1
=
29
30−1=29. You can find these values using a t-table or a calculator. For a 90% confidence interval and 29 degrees of freedom, the critical t-values are approximately -1.645 (left tail) and 1.645 (right tail).

Step 6: Make a Decision

Compare the calculated t-statistic to the critical t-values:

If 
∣
�
∣
>
1.645
∣t∣>1.645, you can reject the null hypothesis.
If 
∣
�
∣
≤
1.645
∣t∣≤1.645, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Calculate the t-statistic based on the values of the sample data and compare it to the critical values to make a decision about whether to reject the null hypothesis.

Step 7: Draw a Conclusion

Based on the analysis, you can draw a conclusion about whether caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level. If the calculated t-statistic falls outside the range defined by the critical values, you will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time. If not, you will fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no significant effect.
